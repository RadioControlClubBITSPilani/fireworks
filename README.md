# ðŸŽ‡ RC Firework Ignition System

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a **remote-controlled ignition system** that enables safe and wireless ignition of two independent firework fuses using a standard RC transmitter. The system provides reliable remote actuation using relay modules controlled by an Arduino Pro Mini, interfaced with an RC receiver.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Dual-channel firework ignition (2 fuses)
- âœ… Wireless control via standard 6-channel RC transmitter/receiver
- âœ… Custom-designed enclosure (Fusion 360 model included)
- âœ… Fully open-source hardware and code
